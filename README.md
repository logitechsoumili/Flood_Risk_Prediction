# ⚠️ Multi-Hazard Disaster Risk Prediction System

A real-time, end-to-end machine learning system for assessing flood and heatwave risks using live meteorological data and advanced classification models.

This platform integrates weather APIs, feature engineering pipelines, and trained ML models into a deployable Streamlit dashboard for actionable disaster risk assessment.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Floods and heatwaves are among the most recurring and destructive climate hazards, especially in rapidly urbanizing and climate-sensitive regions. The increasing frequency of extreme weather events demands scalable, data-driven early warning systems.

Traditional forecasting models are often domain-specific and not easily accessible to the public. This project addresses that gap by building a modular, machine learning-based system capable of real-time, multi-hazard risk classification using live environmental indicators.
